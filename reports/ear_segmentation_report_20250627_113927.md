## Key Metrics

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Health Score | 3.1% | ðŸ”´ |
| Total Issues | 286 | ðŸŸ¡ |
| Auto-fixable | 237 | ðŸŸ¢ |
| Files Analyzed | 42 | - |

## Code Smell Distribution

- **Magic Number**: 234 occurrences
- **Long Method**: 28 occurrences
- **Long Parameter List**: 16 occurrences
- **Commented Code**: 3 occurrences
- **Long Line**: 3 occurrences
- **Global Variable**: 2 occurrences

## Recommendations

1. **Extract Magic Numbers** - Convert hardcoded values to named constants
2. **Refactor Complex Methods** - Break down long functions into smaller, focused units
3. **Increase Test Coverage** - Add unit tests for critical functionality
4. **Optimize with SwarmSearchCV** - Use PSO for hyperparameter tuning

## Next Steps

- Run `biocode fix` to automatically resolve 237 issues
- Review and refactor high-complexity modules
- Implement suggested optimizations
