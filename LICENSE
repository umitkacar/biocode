IMPORTANT SAFETY WARNING:
This is LIVING CODE - a biological software architecture that can:
- GROW and evolve autonomously
- REPRODUCE and create new instances
- DIE and experience system failures
- MUTATE and change behavior unexpectedly
- SPREAD across systems if not properly contained

USER RESPONSIBILITIES:
1. The user assumes ALL RISKS and FULL RESPONSIBILITY for:
   - Any damage, loss, or harm resulting from the use of this software
   - Security measures and containment of the code
   - Testing in isolated, secure environments
   - Preventing unintended reproduction or spread
   - Monitoring for mutations and unexpected behaviors

2. Users MUST:
   - Test this code in SECURE, ISOLATED environments only
   - Implement proper containment measures
   - Monitor system behavior continuously
   - Have emergency shutdown procedures in place
   - Understand the self-healing and self-modifying nature of the code

3. Umit Kacar, PhD is NOT responsible for:
   - Any direct or indirect damages
   - Loss of data or system integrity
   - Unintended code propagation
   - Security breaches or vulnerabilities
   - Any consequences of the code's autonomous behavior

BIOLOGICAL CODE WARNING:
This software implements biological concepts including cells that can divide, tissues that can grow, organs that can fail, and systems that can evolve. Like biological organisms, this code can exhibit unpredictable emergent behaviors. Users must treat this software with the same caution as handling biological specimens.

By accessing, viewing, or using this software, you acknowledge that:
1. You have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this license
2. You understand the living, self-modifying nature of this code
3. You accept full responsibility for all risks and consequences
