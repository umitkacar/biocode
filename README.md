### *Intelligent Code Colony for Autonomous Problem Solving*

## ⚠️ CRITICAL SAFETY WARNING

**This is LIVING CODE** - a biological software architecture that exhibits autonomous behaviors:

### 🧬 This Code Can:
- **GROW** - Automatically expand and evolve
- **REPRODUCE** - Create copies and spawn new instances  
- **DIE** - Experience failures and system death
- **MUTATE** - Change behavior unexpectedly
- **SPREAD** - Propagate across systems if not contained

### 🛡️ Safety Requirements:
- **ALWAYS** test in isolated, secure environments
- **NEVER** run in production without proper containment
- **MONITOR** continuously for unexpected behaviors
- **IMPLEMENT** emergency shutdown procedures
- **UNDERSTAND** that Umit Kacar, PhD is NOT responsible for ANY damages

**By using this code, you accept FULL RESPONSIBILITY for all risks and consequences.**

## 🧪 Concept Introduction

**BioCode Swarm Intelligence** is a revolutionary framework that implements **swarm intelligence** and **biological organism** concepts for autonomous problem-solving. Your code becomes a living colony of intelligent agents that can collaborate, evolve, and solve complex problems independently - like a hive mind working together!

### 🎯 Why This Approach?

1. **Swarm Intelligence**: Multiple agents working together to solve problems
2. **Self-Healing**: Code that can detect and recover from errors automatically
3. **Dynamic Growth**: Add new features and capabilities at runtime
4. **Organic Communication**: Natural message passing between colony members
5. **Collective Problem Solving**: Agents collaborate to find optimal solutions
6. **Evolution**: Systems that learn and adapt over time
7. **Consciousness Levels**: Dynamic resource allocation based on colony needs
8. **Autonomous Decision Making**: No human intervention required

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Entity-Component-System (ECS) Design

Our revolutionary ECS architecture separates data (Components) from logic (Systems) and identity (Entities), enabling:

#### 🔷 **Entities** - Pure identity containers
```python
entity = Entity()
entity.add_component(HealthComponent(current=100))
entity.add_component(PositionComponent(x=10, y=20))
entity.add_tag("cell")
```

#### 🔶 **Components** - Pure data, no logic
```python
@dataclass
class HealthComponent(Component):
    current: float = 100.0
    maximum: float = 100.0
    regeneration_rate: float = 0.1
```

#### 🔸 **Systems** - Pure logic, process entities with matching components
```python
class LifeSystem(System):
    def required_components(self):
        return [LifeComponent, HealthComponent]
    
    def process(self, delta_time: float):
        for entity in self.get_entities():
            # Process aging, health degradation, etc.
```

#### 🌐 **World** - Orchestrates everything
```python
world = World()
world.add_system(LifeSystem())
world.add_system(EnergySystem())
world.add_entity(entity)
world.update(delta_time=0.016)  # 60 FPS
```

### Mixin Layer - Framework Capabilities

Enhance entities with powerful capabilities without modifying core ECS:

```python
class EnhancedEntity(
    SerializableMixin,    # JSON/Binary serialization
    ObservableMixin,      # Change tracking & notifications
    NetworkableMixin,     # Network sync & replication
    PersistableMixin,     # Database storage
    CacheableMixin,       # In-memory caching
    ReplicableMixin,      # Deep cloning
    VersionableMixin,     # Version control
    ValidatableMixin,     # Data validation
    Entity                # Base ECS entity
):
    pass
```

### Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)

Clean separation of cross-cutting concerns:

```python
# Automatically log all system operations
@weave_aspects(LoggingAspect, PerformanceAspect)
class CriticalSystem(System):
    def process(self, delta_time: float):
        # Your logic here - logging & performance tracking added automatically!
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### ⚠️ Pre-Installation Safety Notice
**IMPORTANT**: Before proceeding, ensure you:
1. Are working in an **isolated environment** (VM or container recommended)
2. Have **backup** of your system
3. Understand this is **LIVING CODE** that can grow, mutate, and die
4. Accept **full responsibility** for any consequences

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Conda (recommended) or virtualenv
- **Isolated test environment**

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/biocode.git
cd biocode

# 2. Create conda environment
conda create -n biocode python=3.11
conda activate biocode

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -e .
# or
poetry install

# 4. Start the API server
python -m uvicorn biocode.interfaces.api.main:app --reload

# 5. Open API documentation

```

### Run the Demo

```bash
# Run the complete Cell → Tissue → Organ → System demo
python demo_biocode_flow.py

## 💻 Working Example

### Create a Living Cell Colony with ECS

```python
from biocode.ecs import World
from biocode.ecs.systems import LifeSystem, EnergySystem, OrganelleSystem
from biocode.factories import CellFactory
from biocode.aspects import LoggingAspect, PerformanceAspect, AspectWeaver

# Create the world
world = World()

# Add biological systems
world.add_system(LifeSystem())
world.add_system(EnergySystem())
world.add_system(OrganelleSystem())

# Apply aspects for monitoring
weaver = AspectWeaver()
weaver.add_aspect(LoggingAspect())
weaver.add_aspect(PerformanceAspect(alert_threshold_ms=10))

for system in world.systems:
    weaver.weave(system)

# Create a cell factory
factory = CellFactory(world)

# Create different cell types
stem_cell = factory.create_stem_cell(position=(0, 0, 0))
neuron = factory.create_neuron(position=(10, 0, 0))
muscle_cell = factory.create_muscle_cell(position=(20, 0, 0))

# Tag cells for easy querying
stem_cell.add_tag("leader")
neuron.add_tag("thinker")
muscle_cell.add_tag("worker")

# Simulate life
for tick in range(100):
    world.update(delta_time=0.016)  # 60 FPS
    
    if tick % 10 == 0:
        # Check cell health
        health = stem_cell.get_component(HealthComponent)
        print(f"Tick {tick}: Stem cell health: {health.current:.1f}")

# Query all entities with organelles
cells_with_organelles = world.query(OrganelleComponent)
print(f"\nFound {len(cells_with_organelles)} cells with organelles")

# Get performance metrics
metrics = weaver.aspects[1].get_metrics()  # PerformanceAspect
print(f"\nPerformance: {metrics}")
```
