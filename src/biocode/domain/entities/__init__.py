Domain Entities (Legacy - Moved to ECS Architecture)
Copyright (c) 2024 Umit Kacar, PhD. All rights reserved.

NOTE: The old OOP-based entities (Cell, Tissue, Organ, System) have been 
archived and replaced with the new Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture.

For the new architecture, see:
- src/biocode/ecs/ - Core ECS implementation
- src/biocode/factories/ - Entity creation factories
- src/biocode/mixins/ - Framework capabilities
- src/biocode/aspects/ - Cross-cutting concerns

The old files have been moved to: archive/old_domain_entities/
